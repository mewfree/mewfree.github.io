I've been feeling like opening a static blog those past few days. I wanted to write down some of my thoughts, kind of like a journal.
I've been using [jrnl](http://maebert.github.io/jrnl/) in the past but I didn't quite keep up with it and felt like it would be more
interesting to share those thoughts with other people as well.

I wanted to be able to edit the blog using a simple setup using stuff I am already familiar with like Markdown formatting and Vim.
Then I remembered about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) from my brief encounter with the Ruby ecosystem (I nowadays mostly code in NodeJS and Python).
I did a quick local setup and realized by reading the documentation that it was natively supported by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
so I jumped on the occasion since I wasn't too keen on setting up a dedicated hosting system for this
(eventhough I have a weird obsession for tinkering with servers).

So here it is, I have no idea how often I'll post, probably whenever I feel like having an idea worth writing a blog post for.
